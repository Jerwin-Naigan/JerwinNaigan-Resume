        <div class="subheading mb-5">2nd year Anthropology Major at UCR ðŸ—¿</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jerwin Naigan. I am a 2nd year anthropology major at the University of California, Riverside. Currently, I am working towards my anthropology degree but I have been meaning to start a double major in tandem with psychology due to overlapping concepts and beliefs held within these 2 branches of social sciences. Iâ€™ve gained anthropological class experience regarding the 4 main branches of anthropology which are as follows: Cultural Anthropology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology, and Archaeology. My passion towards psychology started around the time I was in 8th grade and has sparked my academic pursuit of it for 4 years. 
<br><br>

        Cultural Anthropology has taught me the importance of distinguishing culture as a way to distinguish humans from other animals. Biological Anthropology gave me a new understanding of the evolution of humans over millions of years and our eventual rise to dominance as a civilization. Linguistic Anthropology educated me on the nuances of language structure and how they are impacted by the prospectâ€™s of human societies. Archaeology ended up teaching me the value of previous cultures and societies and how we can learn about being humans by studying their ancient past remains. I also mentioned my goal towards a second degree in psychology in which I have also extensive work experience and personal attributes towards. I was once recommended towards a psychiatrist due to my struggling mental health and quickly realized just how important it is in keeping my own mental health in check. That psychiatrist inspired me and thatâ€™s when I knew I wanted to also start my work dealing with psychological problems in a way that makes me and others happy. Even if I do or donâ€™t end up in the psychiatric field, I would still like to pursue a career in a more psychological based environment whether it's a field that directly helps others, experiments on behaviors, social work, etc. All that matters to me is to find a purpose in trying to understand and better others in which anthropology and psychology help greatly.
<br><br>

        My hobbies include exploring the internet, playing video games, doing cardio, etc. Through these hobbies has inspired me to a deep passion and motivation to completing my goals in life and to be open-minded to all that I have learned. I have had multiple goals to keep my weight in check and cardio both indoors and outdoors has led me to that goal as well as an iron will to keep going. Video games gave me a competitive spirit and an unending desire to complete the task at hand. Exploring the internet helps broaden my understanding and beliefs of what I learn. In tandem with my experiences in my hobbies, this deep passion and motivation has made its way towards my academic life in which I will never give up in my studies towards my degrees. Nor will I give up on anyone who depends on me for support whether that be my family, friends, workers, clients, etc. I am dedicated to my work and I hope everyone else should find that passion that they can feel happy to dedicate themselves into.
